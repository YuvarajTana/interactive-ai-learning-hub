## Cloud Computing Fundamentals

### What is Cloud Computing?
Cloud computing is the delivery of computing services over the internet, including servers, storage, databases, networking, software, analytics, and intelligence. Instead of owning physical infrastructure, you access these resources on-demand from cloud providers.

### Key Characteristics
- **On-demand self-service**: Resources available when needed
- **Broad network access**: Accessible from anywhere via internet
- **Resource pooling**: Shared resources across multiple users
- **Rapid elasticity**: Scale up or down quickly
- **Measured service**: Pay only for what you use

### Service Models
- **IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service)**: Virtual machines, storage, networks
- **PaaS (Platform as a Service)**: Development platforms, databases
- **SaaS (Software as a Service)**: Complete applications (Gmail, Office 365)

### Deployment Models
- **Public Cloud**: Services offered over public internet
- **Private Cloud**: Dedicated infrastructure for one organization
- **Hybrid Cloud**: Combination of public and private
- **Multi-cloud**: Using multiple cloud providers

### Benefits of Cloud Computing
- Cost reduction and optimization
- Scalability and flexibility
- Reliability and availability
- Security (when properly configured)
- Global reach and accessibility
- Innovation and speed to market

## Introduction to AWS

### What is Amazon Web Services (AWS)?
AWS is Amazon's comprehensive cloud computing platform, offering over 200 services including compute, storage, databases, machine learning, analytics, and more. Launched in 2006, it's the world's leading cloud provider.

### AWS Global Infrastructure
- **Regions**: Geographic locations with multiple data centers (33+ regions)
- **Availability Zones (AZs)**: Isolated data centers within regions
- **Edge Locations**: Content delivery network endpoints (400+ locations)
- **Local Zones**: Extensions of regions for ultra-low latency

### AWS Shared Responsibility Model
- **AWS Responsibility**: Security "of" the cloud (infrastructure, hardware, software)
- **Customer Responsibility**: Security "in" the cloud (data, applications, access management)
