## Introduction to System Design {#introduction}

System design is the process of defining the architecture, components, modules, interfaces, and data for a system to satisfy specified requirements. It bridges the gap between problem requirements and implementation.

### Why System Design Matters
- **Scalability**: Handle increasing load gracefully
- **Reliability**: Minimize downtime and failures
- **Performance**: Optimize response times and throughput
- **Maintainability**: Enable easy updates and modifications
- **Cost Efficiency**: Optimize resource utilization

---

## Fundamentals {#fundamentals}

### Core Concepts Every Designer Must Know

#### 1. Scalability
- **Vertical Scaling (Scale Up)**: Adding more power to existing machines
- **Horizontal Scaling (Scale Out)**: Adding more machines to the pool

#### 2. Reliability and Availability
- **Reliability**: System performs correctly during a specific duration
- **Availability**: System remains operational over time
- **SLA/SLO/SLI**: Service level agreements, objectives, and indicators

#### 3. Consistency Models
- **Strong Consistency**: All nodes see the same data simultaneously
- **Eventual Consistency**: System becomes consistent over time
- **Weak Consistency**: No guarantees when all nodes will be consistent

#### 4. CAP Theorem
You can only guarantee 2 out of 3:
- **Consistency**: All nodes see the same data
- **Availability**: System remains operational
- **Partition Tolerance**: System continues despite network failures

#### 5. Load Balancing
- **Round Robin**: Requests distributed sequentially
- **Least Connections**: Route to server with fewest active connections
- **Weighted Round Robin**: Assign weights based on server capacity
- **IP Hash**: Route based on client IP

#### 6. Caching Strategies
- **Cache-aside**: Application manages cache
- **Write-through**: Write to cache and database simultaneously
- **Write-behind**: Write to cache immediately, database later
- **Refresh-ahead**: Proactively refresh cache before expiration

#### 7. Database Concepts
- **SQL vs NoSQL**: Structured vs flexible data models
- **ACID Properties**: Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability
- **Database Sharding**: Horizontal partitioning of data
- **Replication**: Master-slave, master-master configurations

## High Level Design (HLD) {#high-level-design}

### What is HLD?
High Level Design provides a bird's eye view of the system architecture, focusing on major components and their interactions without diving into implementation details.

### HLD Components

#### 1. System Architecture Diagram
- Client applications (web, mobile, APIs)
- Load balancers
- Application servers
- Databases
- External services
- CDN and caching layers

#### 2. Data Flow
- Request/response patterns
- Data synchronization
- Event flows
- Message queues

#### 3. Technology Stack
- Programming languages
- Frameworks
- Databases
- Infrastructure choices

### HLD Best Practices

#### Start with Requirements
```
Functional Requirements:
- What the system should do
- User stories and use cases
- Core features

Non-Functional Requirements:
- Performance (latency, throughput)
- Scalability (users, data, requests)
- Availability (uptime requirements)
- Security (authentication, authorization)
```

#### Design Process
1. **Clarify Requirements**: Ask questions, define scope
2. **Estimate Scale**: Users, data, QPS (queries per second)
3. **High-Level Architecture**: Major components
4. **Deep Dive**: Detailed component design
5. **Scale the Design**: Handle bottlenecks
6. **Summarize**: Review and validate

#### Common HLD Patterns

**Microservices Architecture**
```
Benefits:

- Decorator: Add behavior to objects dynamically
- Facade: Provide simplified interface to complex subsystem

**Behavioral Patterns**
- Observer: Define subscription mechanism
- Strategy: Define family of algorithms

#### Database Design

**Normalization**
```
1NF: Atomic values, no repeating groups
2NF: No partial dependencies on composite keys
3NF: No transitive dependencies
BCNF: Every determinant is a candidate key
```

**Indexing Strategy**
```
Primary Index: On primary key
Secondary Index: On frequently queried columns
Composite Index: On multiple columns
Covering Index: Include all required columns
```
